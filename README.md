Overview

This AI-powered application allows users to analyze multiple news articles simultaneously by providing URLs, then ask natural language questions to extract insights and information across sources.

Project Highlights

âœ… Web Content Extraction & Processing

Extracted and processed content from multiple news URLs using LangChain's WebBaseLoader with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for optimal context retention in a streamlined pipeline.

âœ… Vector Database Implementation with FAISS

Implemented Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) with OpenAI embeddings for efficient semantic retrieval, using session-based storage to maintain context throughout user interactions.

âœ… LLM-powered Question Answering System

Created an information extraction system with OpenAI's language models via LangChain's RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain, providing source attribution and balancing accuracy with token optimization.

âœ… Interactive Streamlit Web Application

Built an intuitive UI with Streamlit featuring URL inputs, processing indicators, and query functionality with real-time feedback mechanisms in a responsive layout.

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or higher

pip (Python package installer)

Step 1: Clone the Repository
bashCopygit clone [your-repository-url]
cd [repository-name]

Step 2: Install Dependencies
